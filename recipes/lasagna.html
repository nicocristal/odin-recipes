        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups)</li>
            <li>12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 3 cups), divided</li>
            <li>15 dry lasagna noodles (not no-boil, about 2/3 of a 1-pound box), divided</li>
            <li>15 to 16 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese (about 2 cups), divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 400ºF. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400°F.</li>
            <li>Brown the beef and onion. Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion. 
                Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger regular or cast iron skillet over 
                medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon
                kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and cook, breaking the beef 
                up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.
                Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce. Open 1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara
                sauce (3 cups). Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                Stir the remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture.</li>
            <li>Begin layering the lasagna. Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese if needed (3 cups).
                Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking dish, breaking them if needed to create a single
                layer (it's OK if the noodles overlap slightly). Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta
                cheese over the noodles. Dollop and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the
                ricotta, then sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Continue layering the lasagna. Arrange 5 more noodles over the mozzarella, followed 
                by 1 cup of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce, and 1 cup of the mozzarella.
                Top with a final layer of 5 noodles and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin so 
                that it almost completely covers the noodles. (Reserve the remaining 1 cup mozzarella for
                the end of baking.) Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour. Bake for 1 hour. Check to make sure the noodles are done by
                poking the lasagna with a knife; the knife should slide easily through all the layers.
                If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking. Uncover the lasagna and 
                sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake uncovered until the mozzarella is 
                melted and lightly browned, and the sauce is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes. Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack for at 
                least 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
