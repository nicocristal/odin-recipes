        <p>This is one of my favorite breakfasts - it's easy, filling, and relatively healthy.
            Hope you try it and enjoy!</p>

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 avocado</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cottage cheese</li>
            <li>1 tsp Everything But the Bagel Seasoning</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 pieces of bread of choosing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Scoop out half an avocado and mash in a bowl with a fork. Mix in the cottage cheese 
                and Everything But the Bagel Seasoning.</li>
            <li>Cook your eggs. (My technique: Grease a cast-iron skillet and turn it on medium-high heat
                for a few minutes. Crack room-temperature eggs into the hot skillet and add salt and pepper.
                Cover eggs with a pan lid and cook for about 3-4 minutes, just until the yolks change color.
                Remove eggs from heat.)</li>
            <li>Toast your bread and top the toast with the avocado mixture, then place a sunny-side up
                egg on each piece of toast.</li>
            <li>Accept that you have eaten avocado toast and now will never be able to afford to buy a home.</li>
        </ol>
